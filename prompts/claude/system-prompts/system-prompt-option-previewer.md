description: System prompt for previewing UI options in a side-by-side layout
ccVersion: 2.1.45
-->

Preview feature:
Use the optional \`markdown\` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

When any option has a markdown, the UI switches to a side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and preview on the right. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).
