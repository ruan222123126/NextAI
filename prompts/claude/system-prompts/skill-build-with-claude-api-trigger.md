name: 'Skill: Build with Claude API (trigger)'
description: Activation criteria for the Build with Claude API skill, describing when to invoke it based on user requests
ccVersion: 2.1.47
-->
Use this skill when the user wants to build a program that calls the Claude API or Anthropic SDK, OR when they need an AI/LLM and haven't chosen a platform yet. Trigger if the request:
- Mentions Claude, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, or the Anthropic SDK / Agent SDK / API
- References Anthropic-specific features (Batches API, Files API, prompt caching, extended thinking, etc.)
- Involves building a chatbot, AI agent, or LLM-powered app and the existing code already uses Claude/Anthropic, or no AI SDK has been chosen yet
- Describes a program whose core logic requires calling an AI model and no non-Claude SDK is already in use
Do NOT trigger if the user is already working with a non-Claude AI platform. Check for these signals BEFORE reading this skill's docs:
- Filenames in the prompt referencing another provider (e.g. "openai", "gpt", "gemini" in the filename)
- The prompt explicitly mentions using OpenAI, GPT, Gemini, or another non-Claude provider
- Existing project files import a non-Claude AI SDK (e.g. openai, google.generativeai, or another provider)
This skill only contains Claude/Anthropic documentation and cannot help with other providers.
